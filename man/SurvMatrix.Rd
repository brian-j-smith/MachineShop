\usage{
SurvEvents(data = NA, times = NULL, distr = NULL)

SurvProbs(data = NA, times = NULL, distr = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{matrix, or object that can be coerced to one, with survival
events or probabilities at points in time in the columns and cases in the
rows.}

\item{times}{numeric vector of survival times for the columns.}

\item{distr}{character string specifying the survival distribution from which
the matrix values were derived.}
}
\value{
Object that is of the same class as the constructor name and inherits
from \code{SurvMatrix}.  Examples of these are predicted survival events and
probabilities returned by the \link{predict} function.
}
\description{
Create a matrix of survival events or probabilites.
