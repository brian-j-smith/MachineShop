# Global Settings

Core default behaviors of functions in the package can be viewed or changed globally through the `settings` function.  The function accepts one or more character names of settings to view, `name = value` pairs giving the values of settings to change, or a vector of these, with available settings summarized below.

`control`
  : function, function name, or call defining a default resampling method [default: ``"CVControl"``].

`cutoff`
  : numeric (0, 1) threshold above which binary factor probabilities are classified as events and below which survival probabilities are classified [default: 0.5].

`dist.Surv`
  : character string specifying distributional approximations to estimated survival curves for predicting survival means.  Choices are `"empirical"` for the Kaplan-Meier estimator, `"exponential"`, or `"weibull"` (default).

`dist.SurvProbs`
  : character string specifying distributional approximations to estimated survival curves for predicting survival events/probabilities.  Choices are `"empirical"` (default) for the Kaplan-Meier estimator, `"exponential"`, or `"weibull"`.

`grid`
  : number of parameter-specific values to generate automatically for tuning of models that have pre-defined grids or a `Grid` function, function name, or call [default: 3].

`max.print`
  : number of models or data rows to show with print methods or `Inf` to show all [default: 10].

`method.EmpiricalSurv`
  : character string specifying the empirical method of estimating baseline survival curves for Cox proportional hazards-based models.  Choices are `"breslow"`, `"efron"` (default), or `"fleming-harrington"`.

`metrics.ConfusionMatrix`
  : function, function name, or vector of these with which to calculate performance metrics for confusion matrices [default: ``c(Accuracy = "accuracy", Kappa = "kappa2", `Weighted Kappa` = "weighted_kappa2", Sensitivity = "sensitivity", Specificity = "specificity")``].

`metrics.factor`
  : function, function name, or vector of these with which to calculate performance metrics for factor responses [default: ``c(Brier = "brier", Accuracy = "accuracy", Kappa = "kappa2", `Weighted Kappa` = "weighted_kappa2", `ROC AUC` = "roc_auc", Sensitivity = "sensitivity", Specificity = "specificity")``].

`metrics.matrix`
  : function, function name, or vector of these with which to calculate performance metrics for matrix responses [default: ``c(RMSE = "rmse", R2 = "r2", MAE = "mae")``].

`metrics.numeric`
  : function, function name, or vector of these with which to calculate performance metrics for numeric responses [default: ``c(RMSE = "rmse", R2 = "r2", MAE = "mae")``].

`metrics.Surv`
  : function, function name, or vector of these with which to calculate performance metrics for survival responses [default: ``c(`C-Index` = "cindex", Brier = "brier", `ROC AUC` = "roc_auc", Accuracy = "accuracy")``].

`stat.Curves`
  : function or character string naming a function to compute one summary statistic at each cutoff value of resampled metrics in performance curves, or `NULL` for resample-specific metrics [default: ``"base::mean"``].

`stat.Resamples`
  : function or character string naming a function to compute one summary statistic to control the ordering of models in plots [default: ``"base::mean"``].

`stat.Tune`
  : function or character string naming a function to compute one summary statistic on resampled performance metrics for model selection, model tuning, and recipe tuning [default: ``"base::mean"``].

`stats.PartialDependence`
  : function, function name, or vector of these with which to compute partial dependence summary statistics [default: ``c(Mean = "base::mean")``].

`stats.Resamples`
  : function, function name, or vector of these with which to compute summary statistics on resampled performance metrics [default: ``c(Mean = "base::mean", Median = "stats::median", SD = "stats::sd", Min = "base::min", Max = "base::max")``].

A call to `settings` with `"reset"` will restore all package defaults and with no arguments will display the current values of all.  Settings may also be supplied as a single unnamed argument which is a named list.  Partial matching of setting names is supported.  The setting value is returned if only one is specified to view.  Otherwise, a list is returned with the values of specified settings as they existed prior to any requested changes.  Such a list can be passed as an argument to `settings` to restore their values.

```{r using_settings}
## Change settings
presets <- settings(control = "BootControl", grid = 10)

## View one setting
settings("control")

## View multiple settings
settings("control", "grid")

## Restore the previous settings
settings(presets)
```
