# Description

**MachineShop** is a meta-package for statistical and machine learning with a unified interface for model fitting, prediction, performance assessment, and presentation of results.  Support is provided for predictive modeling of numerical, categorical, and censored time-to-event outcomes and for resample (bootstrap, cross-validation, and split training-test sets) estimation of model performance.  This vignette introduces the package interface with a survival data analysis example, followed by supported methods of variable specification; applications to other response variable types; available performance metrics, resampling techniques, and graphical and tabular summaries; and modeling strategies.


# Features

```{r overview_modelinfo, echo=FALSE}
library(MachineShop)
info <- modelinfo()
```

* Unified and concise interface for model fitting, prediction, and performance assessment.
* Support for `r length(info)`+ models from `r length(unique(sapply(info, function(x) x$packages[1])))` **R** packages, including model specifications from the [**parsnip**](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/) package.
* Dynamic model parameters.
* Ensemble modeling with stacked regression and super learners.
* Modeling of response variables types: binary factors, multi-class nominal and ordinal factors, numeric vectors and matrices, and censored time-to-event survival.
* Model specification with traditional formulas, design matrices, and flexible pre-processing [recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/).
* Resample estimation of predictive performance, including cross-validation, bootstrap resampling, and split training-test set validation.
* Parallel execution of resampling algorithms.
* Choices of performance metrics: accuracy, areas under ROC and precision recall curves, Brier score, coefficient of determination (R^2^), concordance index, cross entropy, F score, Gini coefficient, unweighted and weighted Cohen's kappa, mean absolute error, mean squared error, mean squared log error, positive and negative predictive values, precision and recall, and sensitivity and specificity.
* Graphical and tabular performance summaries: calibration curves, confusion matrices, partial dependence plots, performance curves, lift curves, and model-specific and permutation-based variable importance.
* Model tuning over automatically generated grids of parameter values and randomly sampled grid points.
* Model selection and comparisons for any combination of models and model parameter values.
* Recursive feature elimination.
* User-definable models and performance metrics.
